This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}
library(datasets)
data(airquality)
summary(airquality)
```

Lets make a pairs plot of the data
```{r}
pairs(airquality)
```
here is a regression model of ozone on wind, solar radiation, and temperature
```{r}
library(stats)
fit<-lm(Ozone ~ Wind + Solar.R + Temp, data=airquality)
summary(fit)
```
